# IPv4 subnetter unfinished
This project is a calculator for IPv4, This script takes your IPv4 input and output a binary form for both the IP address and CIDR. 

for example `10.20.30.40/18` anything else that is not in this format will be rejected

# How to use:

This script is very simple to run, simply type it and give your IPv4 address with CIDR notation.

```bash
./IPv4-calculator 10.20.30.40/24
```

this will return `10.20.30.40` in binary and also return `/24` in binary also

Thank you for your time, This script is not finished right now and will be done later once i get more time.
